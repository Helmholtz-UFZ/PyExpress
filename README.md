# PyExpress

PyExpress version 1.0.0 is a Python library for automating photogrammetric image processing using the Agisoft Metashape Python API.
It extends Metashape’s functionality, for example, by adding utility and data management tools, and offers a range of methods for developing tailored,
fully automated workflows for photogrammetric analysis on images captured by UAVs and fixed camera systems.
Additionally, PyExpress supports 4D photogrammetry for continuous monitoring with fixed stereo camera setups, and integrates with MinIO for efficient cloud storage management. It automates the generation of point clouds, orthomosaics, DEMs, 3D models, precision maps, and more. 
Thus, PyExpress generates data products or time-series of data products, serving various applications such as GIS, CloudCompare, or precision mapping.
